This isn't so much as a project I did to use, but rather a project I made
so that I know absolutely every part of the laboration of a 
database-and-webdev course I'm going to have to take next year.

I wanted to have everything done by now, since I know how to, and instead
focus my time on other projects and things when the course comes around.
